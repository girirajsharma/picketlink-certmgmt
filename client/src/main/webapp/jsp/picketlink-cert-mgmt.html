<p>Users suffer when applications they use are beset by inconsistent interface behaviors and visual designs. 
 Inconsistency makes products more difficult to learn and use by requiring users to relearn common 
 interactions when moving from product to product or when migrating from competitive products. 
 PatternFly addresses this problem by providing a set of consistent visual design principles and 
 behavioral patterns that can be applied across enterprise IT products and applications. 
 The goal is to develop reusable assets and guidelines that can be applied broadly by either 
 designers or developers of applications targeted for a variety of IT users including developers, 
 system administrators, and business professionals.</p>
